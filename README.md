# Data-Driven Sales Insights Dashboard: An End-to-End Analysis in Excel
This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales data for a hypothetical company, focusing on key metrics across regions, demographics, and sales performance. The Excel file contains various sheets with raw data, cleaned data, pivot tables, dashboards, and visualizations that answer business-critical questions regarding revenue, profit, and team performance.

## Structure
The Excel file comprises the following sheets:

 - Old data: Contains raw sales data with details such as date, customer demographics, location, product categories, and financial metrics.
 - Cleaned data: A processed version of the original data with additional columns (e.g., "Month" and "Age Group") for more refined analysis.
 - Sales Team: Lists each sales representative by country, along with their revenue targets.
 - Questions: Outlines the main analytical questions that guide the analysis, such as total revenue, best-selling regions, and revenue by age group.
 - Pivot tables: Provides summary views of data through pivot tables, focusing on sales by countries, age groups, and product categories.
 - Distribution Dashboard: Contains visualizations to illustrate sales distribution across various regions and demographics.
 - Financial Dashboard: Displays key financial metrics, including revenue and profit, for high-level insights.
 - Sales Team performance: Highlights the performance metrics of each sales representative in relation to their targets.
   
## Analysis & Visualizations
This analysis answers the following key business questions:

 - What are the total revenues and profits?
 - Which regions and states have the highest and lowest sales?
 - How do customer demographics (age, gender) impact revenue?
 - Which products or categories are the best sellers?
 - How does each sales team member perform against their target?

### Observations and Recommendations
 - Country Sales Distribution: Sales volume in three countries is significantly lower compared to the United States. To strengthen the company’s market presence, additional marketing 
   efforts are suggested across all regions, aiming to sustain growth in strong markets while expanding potential in lower-performing regions.

 - State-Level Sales Performance: High-performing states continue to contribute significantly to overall sales, indicating an opportunity for focused marketing in these regions to 
   leverage and enhance existing strengths.

 - Low-Sales States: Certain low-sales states do not generate enough revenue to justify their costs. Two potential strategies could be implemented: either intensifying efforts to balance 
   profitability in these areas or discontinuing focus to streamline resources.

 - Demographic Insights – Age Group: The middle-aged demographic (ages 30-50) shows the highest purchasing activity, suggesting a focused approach on this group with targeted promotions 
   and exclusive offers to maximize sales impact.

## Financial Dashboard:

 - Monthly Sales Peaks: December and August show the highest sales, profit, and cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating seasonal peaks. This trend suggests an opportunity to capitalize on 
   these months with targeted marketing and inventory planning to maximize profitability.

 - Bikes Category Profitability: The Bikes category is currently operating at a loss, which raises questions about its continued viability. Evaluating whether to discontinue or 
   restructure this category could optimize resource allocation.

 - Top-Performing Sub-Categories: Tires, jerseys, and helmets are the leading sub-categories in terms of sales. Increasing focus on these items and promoting upselling strategies within 
   these categories could drive further revenue growth.

## Sales Team performance:

 - Recognize and Reward Andrew Jason: Given his high revenue and achievement beyond his target, consider recognizing Andrew Jason’s performance to maintain motivation and set a benchmark 
   for others.

 - Support Underperforming Team Members: Implement targeted training and support for the other team members who have not yet met their targets, focusing on strategies to enhance their 
   sales effectiveness.

 - Leverage John Adams' Profit Strategy: As John Adams demonstrates the highest profit efficiency, examine his approach to identify and share best practices across the team, potentially 
   increasing profitability for other representatives.
